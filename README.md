## Problem statement

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This
plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so
that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain
to send back to Earth. A rover’s position and location is represented by a
combination of x and y coordinates, and a letter representing one of the four
cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify
navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in
the bottom left corner and facing North. In order to control a rover, NASA
sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are ‘L’, ‘R’ and ‘M’.
‘L’ and ‘R’ make the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without
moving from its current spot. ‘M’ means move forward one grid point, and
maintain the same heading. Assume that the square directly North from (x, y)
is (x, y+1).

### Input

* The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the
  lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
* The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been
  deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line gives the
  rover’s position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling
  the rover how to explore the plateau.
* The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces,
  corresponding to the x and y coordinates and the rover’s orientation.
* Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover
  won’t start to move until the first one has finished moving.

### Output

* The output for each rover should be its final coordinates and heading.

### Example

#### Input

```
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
```

#### Expected Output

```
1 3 N
5 1 E
```

## Approaches

The Rover Problem describes a series of vector additions in terms of simple
commands to a hypothetical Mars Rover vehicle.

I ignore that the grid is rectangular, and has edges. Mars is a sphere
(roughly), not a plane, so is finite yet unbounded.

The rover may 1) turn left (L), 2) turn right (R), or 3) move forward 1. It
has an initial compass orientation relative to the Euclidean plane, and begins
at the origin. There are no restrictions on the instructions; the vehicle may
spin in a circle or traverse a lengthy line or any mixture of these.

Your goal is to state the final plane coordinates and orientation of the
vehicle after processing the instruction string.

### Vectors

The initial orientation sets the direction of the first vector. Any sequence
of turns is the sum of each turn, e.g., turning left twice is pointing in the
opposite direction.

So the vectors are a direction and a distance, as learned in grade school, and
one initially sums the turns before encountering the first distance.
Thereafter the instruction string can be treated as a sum of vectors:

&sum; _dir_ &times; _dist_

### Parsing

1. Treat the initial orientation as a sequence of turn instructions prefixed
   to the instruction string.
2. Read the instruction string as a series of pairs: a direction (sequence of
   turns) paired with a distance (a sequence of moves).
3. Each vector takes the previous vector for its initial direction.
4. Ignore unpaired trailing turn instructions at the end of the string.

### Calculation

Distances are simple sums of the X-axis 1-vector, ``[ 1 0 ]``. So three (3)
move instructions in sequence is ``[ 3 0 ]``.

Recalling that rotations may be represented in the 2-plane as square matricies
using the Circle Group, SO(2):

| Rotation | 2x2 Matrix       |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | ``[  1  0, 0  1 ]`` |
| &pi;/2   | ``[  0 -1, 1  0 ]`` |
| &pi;     | ``[ -1  0, 0 -1 ]`` |
| 3&pi;/2  | ``[  0  1, -1  0 ]`` |

Using matrices, rotations are products; distances remain sums. This can be
seen in that ``[ 0 -1, 1 0 ] ^ 3`` (three lefts) is ``[ 0 1, -1 0 ]`` (one
right).

### Solution styles

I presented these
solutions&mdash;["C" style](./src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/rover/CStyle.kt) and
["math" style](src/main/kotlin/hm/binkley/rover/Mathy.kt)&mdash;to coworkers,
both of which surprised them. I expected that
[matrix form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) of
[the circle group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_group) is unfamiliar
to most. Myself, I was surprised that the "C" style was unfamiliar to
coworkers! (None I spoke with had familiarity with "C" or FORTRAN or other
classical means of programming.) In fact, the "math" style, though abstract
algebra was not understood, spoke more to them by its use of OOP.

An actual Mars Rover would code using the "C" style approach&mdash;you have
limited hardware, harsh conditions, and need absolute certainty of
correctness, something more easily confirmed automatically with a "C"
style of code than "math", and heavily optimized by compilers. Automated or
formal verification
is [an important CS research area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification)
.

### Problem problems

I note that the problem as given is both _under-specified_ and
_over-specified_. I suspect this is intentional: that the problem-givers are
looking to see if problem-solvers notice, and if so, how they might address.
For example:

- Why does the grid have a boundary limit? The surface of a globe has no
  boundary
- The sample input does not approach the boundary
- What should be the behavior for malformed input?
- How to manage a "squad" of rovers? Can the crash into each other?
- Why are starting positions for next instruction not the same as ending
  positions after following the current instructions? Are these representing
  different rovers?

An actual Mars Rover would need to handle these issues sensibly, and they are
not, in fact, simple problems. Consider other programmed hardware, such as a
pacemaker: How to keep someone alive when there is malformed input to the
software?

#### Humor

Honestly I would prefer a solution in
[APL](http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10011550), extremely well-suited to the
task. For the golf version of this problem, APL is ideal, but utterly
unmaintainable. However, I was unable to find a workable text editor on Mac OS
X for the language, not to mention
[keyboard](http://www.users.cloud9.net/~bradmcc/gif/APL_keyboard.gif).

### Errors

To properly diagnose errors in the input requires a "mini-compiler": treat the
input as a DSL (which it is). For example, a real Mars Rover would report to
Earth any of these conditions:

- Malformed input
- Hitting boundaries
- Crashing into another rover

* Drop "OOP" approach: too much duplication with "mathy".
* Tackle boundary and input errors.

### 4

* Ported to Kotlin.

### 3

* (Java) Over-engineered math example. Parsing still primitive.

### 2

* (Java) "math"-style works correctly using rotation matrices from the circle
  group.

* (Java) Testing. Vanilla "C" version (in Java) works correctly. Quite
  succinct.

* (Java) It builds. Completely empty otherwise. This is a tracer release for
  GitHub.
